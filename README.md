ITE1100 Tutorial #4

The purpose of the repository is to learn how to initialize and manage a local git repository.
Also learning how to collab with others, create, commit, push and merge, with the use of pull requests.

Steps:

Installed Git and made an account on Github.
Created a local file and initialized it using git.
Made a second branch and committed a file with a sample message attached.
Push the new branch entirely.
Made a pull request with my partner as the reviewer. Then the files were merged.
